# Shared Library Helm Chart

![Version: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: library](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-library-informational?style=flat-square) 

A contract-based Helm library chart for Kubernetes.

## Features

* Common templates and tools.
* Override support to allow for further customization.

**Note:** Current version doesn't support multiple contexts, so only one instance of each template can be used.

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/StevenJDH/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/shared-library>

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>= 1.19.0-0`

## Usage example

Run the following commands:

```bash
helm repo add stevenjdh https://StevenJDH.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

In the `Chart.yaml` file of a helm chart project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: shared-library
    version: 0.1.0
    repository: "https://StevenJDH.github.io/helm-charts"
```

Finally, run the following command from the same project folder:

```bash
helm dep update .
```

| keda.apiVersion | string | `"keda.sh/v1alpha1"` | apiVersion is the KEDA API to use, which will be either `keda.k8s.io/v1alpha1` or `keda.sh/v1alpha1` depending on whether KEDA is version 1x or 2x respectively. |
| keda.behavior | object | `{}` | behavior is used to modify HPA's scaling behavior for the HPA definition that KEDA will create for a given resource. |
| keda.cooldownPeriod | int | `300` | cooldownPeriod is the period to wait after the last trigger reported active before scaling the resource back to 0. |

The `to` section supports four kinds of selectors which are `podSelector`, `namespaceSelector`, and `ipBlock`. Both `namespaceSelector` and `podSelector` can be combined, but the semantics mean `and` instead of `or` when evaluating. Note: Specifying `- {}` whitelists all outbound traffic and `{}` does the same but on a specific selector, and `- to: []` will block all outbound traffic. Allow policies will override deny policies. Reference [Behavior of to and from selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#behavior-of-to-and-from-selectors). |
| networkPolicy.enabled | bool | `false` | Specifies whether a network policy should be created. Note: This will have no effect unless the chosen CNI supports network policies like Calico, Weave, Cilium, Romana, etc. |
| networkPolicy.ingress | list | `[{}]` | ingress may include a list of allowed ingress rules. Each rule allows traffic which matches both the `from` and `ports` sections. The `from` section supports four kinds of selectors which are `podSelector`, `namespaceSelector`, and `ipBlock`. Both `namespaceSelector` and `podSelector` can be combined, but the semantics mean `and` instead of `or` when evaluating. Note: Specifying `- {}` whitelists all inbound traffic and `{}` does the same but on a specific selector, and `- to: []` will block all inbound traffic. Allow policies will override deny policies. Reference [Behavior of to and from selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#behavior-of-to-and-from-selectors). |
| networkPolicy.policyTypes | list | `["Ingress","Egress"]` | policyTypes indicates whether or not the given policy applies to ingress traffic to the selected pod, egress traffic from the selected pods, or both. If no policy types are specified, then by default, Ingress will always be set and Egress will be set if any egress rules are defined. Reference [The NetworkPolicy resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#networkpolicy-resource). |
| nodeSelector | object | `{"kubernetes.io/os":"linux"}` | nodeSelector is the simplest way to constrain Pods to nodes with specific labels. Use affinity for more advance options. Reference [Assigning Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection). |
| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | podAnnotations are the annotations to be added to the deployment pods. |
| podDisruptionBudget.create | bool | `false` | Indicates whether or not a PodDisruptionBudget resource is created. |
| podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable | int | `1` | minAvailable is the number of pods from that set that must still be available after the eviction, even in the absence of the evicted pod. Only integer values are supported. |
| replicaCount | int | `1` | replicaCount is the number of pod instances created by the Deployment owned ReplicaSet to increase availability when set to more than one. |
| resources | object | `{}` | Optionally request and limit how much CPU and memory (RAM) the container needs. Reference [Resource Management for Pods and Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers). |
| restartPolicy | string | `"Always"` | restartPolicy defines how a pod will automatically repair itself when a problem arises. Reference [Container restart policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy). |
| secrets | object | `{}` | secrets is used to store confidential data in key-value pairs. |
| service.annotations | object | `{}` | annotations to be added to the Service resource. |
| service.appProtocol | bool | `true` | appProtocol overrides annotations in a service resource that were used for setting a backend protocol. In AWS for example, `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http`. See the following GitHub issue for more details [kubernetes/kubernetes#40244](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/40244). Will be ignored for Kubernetes versions older than 1.20. |
| service.clusterIP | string | `""` | clusterIP allows for customizing the cluster IP address of a service resource. |
| service.externalIPs | list | `[]` | externalIPs is a list of IP addresses at which a service is available at. Reference [External IPs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#external-ips). |
| service.externalTrafficPolicy | string | `""` | externalTrafficPolicy is an annotation set on a service resource. It defines how traffic incoming to a node is load balanced. `Cluster` is normally the default policy, but `Local` is often used to preserve the source IP of traffic coming into a cluster node. With Local, requests are load balanced equally across nodes irrespective of how many pods are on each node. When set to Cluster, both nodes and pods are taken into consideration. Applicable only when `service.type` is `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`. Reference [Preserving the client source IP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip). |
| service.healthCheckNodePort | int | `0` | healthCheckNodePort specifies the health check node port (numeric port number) for the service. If healthCheckNodePort isnâ€™t specified, the service controller allocates a port from your clusterâ€™s NodePort range. Reference [Preserving the client source IP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip). |
| service.ipFamilies | list | `["IPv4"]` | ipFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to a service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. [IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack). |
| service.ipFamilyPolicy | string | `"SingleStack"` | ipFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service. Possible values are SingleStack, PreferDualStack or RequireDualStack. The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. Reference [IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack). |
| service.loadBalancerIP | string | `""` | loadBalancerIP is a field used by cloud providers to connect the resulting `LoadBalancer` created by a service resource to a pre-existing static IP. This field is deprecated as of Kubernetes 1.24.0 since it doesn't support dual-stack, but there is no replacement as of yet. Most likely cloud providers will adopt a provider specific annotation approach for this. Progress can be tracked here [kubernetes/enhancements#1992](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1992). Reference [Type LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer). |
| service.loadBalancerSourceRanges | list | `[]` | loadBalancerSourceRanges is a list of one or more internal or external IP address ranges. If not set, a Service will accept traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). |
| service.sessionAffinity | string | `"None"` | sessionAffinity ensures that connections from a particular client are passed to the same Pod each time based on the client's IP address. Must be either "None" or "ClientIP" if set. Reference [User space proxy mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#proxy-mode-userspace). |
| service.type | string | `"ClusterIP"` | type specifies what kind of Service resource to create. |
| serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` | annotations to be added to the Service Account resource. |
| serviceAccount.aws.irsa.audience | string | `"sts.amazonaws.com"` | audience sets the intended recipient of the token. |
| serviceAccount.aws.irsa.enabled | bool | `true` | Specifies whether or not to enable support for AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA). Static credentials will be required if this is set to false. |
| serviceAccount.aws.irsa.roleArn | string | `""` | roleArn is the ARN of an IAM role with a web identity provider. For example, `arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/example-irsa-role`. |
| serviceAccount.aws.irsa.stsRegionalEndpoints | string | `"true"` | stsRegionalEndpoints specifies whether or not to use an STS regional endpoint instead of a global one. It is recommended to use a regional endpoint in almost all cases. |
| serviceAccount.aws.irsa.tokenExpiration | int | `86400` | tokenExpiration is the token expiration duration in seconds. Default is 1 day. |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Specifies whether a service account should be created. |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | The name of the service account to use. If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` | tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule pods onto nodes with matching taints. Reference [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration). |
| updateStrategy | object | `{}` | The update strategy to apply to the Deployment resource. |
